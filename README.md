# Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, we address the problem of sentiment analysis on a corpus of text data. We use a number of machine learning and deep learning methods to perform sentiment analysis. Following which we will choose the best fit model based on their accuracy scores and use that for our sentiment analysis. The experimental results suggest that using a particular method is subjective to its application.
